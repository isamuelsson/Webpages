    	<p> Hi my name is <strong>Isabella Samuelsson</strong> and I am a freshman at NC State University. 
		I am currently <em>Computer Science Intent</em> and plan to coda into this major in the Spring. 
		I am also extremly interested in Biology, Chemistry and genetics so I may minor in Genetics or Chemical engineering as well.
		I chose Computer Science as my major because I enjoy the problem solving and critical thinking required to write and get a program to work. 
		</p>

		<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size: 16px; color: #0000FF; text-align: left;"> My dream job would be to <ins>utilize my programming experience to further research in stem cells and gentics.</ins> 
		With this job I would get to problem solve but also learn more about genetics and human biology.
		Another dream job would be to work in Cybersecurity or Web Development and have the ability to choose if I wanted to work some days at an office or remotely from wherever I wanted to travel. 
		In this job I wouldn't get to learn more about human biology but I would get to problem solve, travel, experience new cultures and unique people.
		</p>
